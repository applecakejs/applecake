In the `components` folder the are components .
every component is a function that return a html-code string.

for example thisis a simple component :
```js
const a = () =>{
    return (
        `
        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        `
    )
}
```
you don't need to use Parentheses or backtick , you can write it like this :
```
"<h1>hello world</h1>"
```

**important note**: components cannot take any parameters .
