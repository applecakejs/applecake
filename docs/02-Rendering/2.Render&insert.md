After that you wrote  your first component you have to render that .
we have two ways to render it .
you have to write these functions in render.js
# Render
Syntax :
```js
Render(
    id-to-be-rendered-init ,
    component-that-you-have-created()
)
```
# Insert
```js
Insert(
    id-to-be-rendered-init ,
    component-that-you-have-created()
)
```
## diffrence betweeen render and Insert
Insert will delete every thing in the id and write the content but render will add the content ..

**note**: make sure that in index.html scripts applecake dist files is first then components and at next , render.js
