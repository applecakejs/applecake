IdManager is a object-variable in applecake that allows us to work with the IDs in the .html file . 
for example we can edit , delete and switch the IDs with Idmanager.

This time we want to learn how to edit IDs.

                                                         
                                                         ...
                                                         
                                                         
## Usage
```js
IdManager.edit(oldid , newid)
```
### example 
imagine that we have this in index.html:
```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <title>applecake.js</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">

</head>

<body>
  <p id="hello">bye</p>
  <script src="dist/applecake.js"></script>
  <script src="js/scripts.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
**note when you use make-applecake-app there is no js folder so please make it yourself**
and we have this in js/scripts.js:
```js
IdManager.edit("hello" , "hi")
```
so then after running index.html in browser if we inspect it we would see :
```html
<p id="hi">bye</p>
```
so IdManager will replace old id with new id .
**Very Important Note:Idmanager came in 1.0.0-alpha so you can't use it in 1.0.0-stable**
